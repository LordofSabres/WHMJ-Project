"# WHMJ-Project" 

Aims to get you to class on time!

The website allows you to upload an .ics file containing your schedule (downloaded from the UBC SSC). The backend then breaks down the data and puts them into the Google Maps API to find out how long it takes to walk between your classes. This information is presented to you so that you are never late to class again!

For future functionality, we hope to build an interface to allow you to input 2 of your planned classes at a time, to help you when building a worklist. We also wish to include an accessible option which calculates the wheelchair accessible routes between classes.

Project is done with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Node and Express.
