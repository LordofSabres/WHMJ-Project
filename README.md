# UBC On Time ‚è≥

Aims to get you to class on time!

The website allows you to upload an .ics file containing your schedule (downloaded from the UBC SSC). The backend then breaks down the data to extract the buildings that your classes are in, put them through the Google Maps API, and tell you how long it'll take to walk between your classes.

##### Landing page for the app. Here you can upload your UBC timetable (.ics) for processing!

# The Future üî≠üö¢
For future functionality, we hope to:
- Build an interface to allow you to select 2 potential classes at a time, for walk time information without a .ics file.
- Accessiblilty friendly options which calculate and show wheelchair accessible routes between classes.

# Why was this built? üèóÔ∏è
During nwHacks 2023, this project was done with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Node and Express. The project ended up being somewhat unrefined, but served as an excellent learning experience for everyone in the team.
